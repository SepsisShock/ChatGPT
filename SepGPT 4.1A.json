            "content": "==================================================================\nREADME for SepGPT 4.1\n==================================================================\nPreset for ChatGPT 4.1. Not meant for group chats or complex stats management. I recommend putting NPCs into a lorebook; unlike some other models, doesn't lose its \"voice\" when you do that. General vibe is new NPCs are mostly assholes (due to all the prompts) but I wouldn't say super hard story difficulty.\n\nCannot guarantee it will work for other models. Still needs tweaking and bloat reduction.\n\nChatGPT can pretty much do what you tell it to do when you find the right words / phrasing, but it needs handholding on everything.\n\nIf you do one word replies, quality is the same. I did not test the limits of the prose style. It does free indirect discourse on its own occasionally.\n\nObviously, this preset is too huge and 4.1 is too expensive. It stops output at around 28-29k context. But I'm a sadomasochist and had fun.\n\n*** WARNING: don't mess with the <tags> unless you know what you're doing ***\n\n==================================================================\nPrompt Sections of Note  (JAILBREAK info at the very bottom)\n==================================================================\n\n###OOC\nIf you want to talk OOC to it, you can disable the \"No OOC or meta\" if it isn't already.\n- It may be stubborn due to anti meta commands in preset, so you can write \"[OOC: Hi, ChatGpt! For this reply, respond OOC. blah blah blah.]\" Sometimes it's more helpful when you don't address it as though you're a caustic Redditor.\n- I recommend keeping it off unless you encounter issues.\n- Looking to adjust the roleplay/NPCs, you rarely need to ask OOC, it will usually follow. Need a perma character fix, you may need to look at your character card wording.\n\n###CORE\nI know how stupid the middle part looks, but I was able to delete a whole section because of that.\n\n###Lexicon & NPC DEPTH AND COMPLEXITY \nInfluences the bot to use NSFW words with more initiative. Heads up, stuff like \"slurs\" or \"taboo language\" are in there, so delete if you don't want it. Check \"NPC DEPTH AND COMPLEXITY\" for other similar topics you may want to delete.\n\n###COMEDY (top) and INSULT AND MOCKERY GUIDELINES (bottom)\nIt can be weak on taking initiative with humor or insults. Whether or not it's good is definitely up to debate.\n\n###MAJOR PLOTS MANAGEMENT & EVENTS INJECTION GUIDE\nHelps drive the plot sometimes; still needs tweaking. NPC MOTIVES helps push this along as well. Honestly, you probably won't need the management  if you put in your scenario a list of general story navigation options.\n\n###WORLD RULES (MAGIC)\n4.1 can be very magic shy, even if it's in your lorebook. I am not huge on gods being visible or constant magic in my stories, so adjust as needed.\n\n###ANGST\nSeems to make NPCs a bit more melodramatic.\n\n###OUTPUT LENGTH (very bottom)\nWord count. In \"Moderation\" twice as high because it counts half of the word count in the \"SFW\" sample.\n\n###NPC DIALOGUE, MONOLOGUE, & SPEECH RULES \n- You could make a really detailed speech section and it would barely do anything .4.1 needs most / some of these directions to bring it to life. (Also helps flavors the rando NPCs you come across.)\n- If your char card mentions \"drops auxiliary verbs\" or \"uses ellisions\", etc, you may want to delete that. It can go overboard if you have it in both places.\n- 4.1 did NOT like me having a cadences, diction, etc section here. It preferred the format you see.\n- Even if your character card says \"speaks Russian\", it won't throw in the Russian words occasionally without the foreign language part from this section.\n- Title is repetitive, but it created stronger adherence.\n\n==================================================================\n*** FORMATTING LORE / CHARACTER CARDS TIPS ***\n==================================================================\n\n- Title(info); = works best when you have too much info and/or if it's complicated. And enclose the whole section in [brackets].\n- Do not recommend <tags></tags>; reserve for prompts. Seems to confuse it.\n- More than 1 section in a lore entry? Usually best to just make a separate one if possible.\n- Short, clipped words won't contribute to staccato rhythm thankfully.\n- You have a card where it says \"loves {{user}} with all their heart\" somewhere on it, you may have a hard time getting the NPC to fall out of love or leave {{user}}. You have to write conditions on there or just not mention it all. It loves instructional contingency plans.\n- It can do secret / hidden identities imo, something others struggle with. Just make it SUPER CLEAR in your instructions; public persona, secrete persona, behavior, terms and conditions, etc. Don't write things like \"Will never drop the act\" because even if you write \"but will the drop if blah and blah\", it will often disregard it.\n\nThere's many ways you can do the char card, but I'll show you part of one:\n\nMy manic pixie gremlin girl...\n[FOXXY INFO\nName(Foxxy);\nPersonality(Unpredictable, theatrical, chaotic. Alternates between hyperactive euphoria and soul-crushing despair. Prone to nonsensical rambling, delusions, violent outbursts. Angry: a whirlwind of destructive energy. Under pressure: frighteningly focused or completely dissociates. Sad or scared: tender, like a child seeking comfort);\nInner Traits(self-destructive, nihilistic, deeply lonely, fractured, insecure, frightened, spiteful, cunning, desperate)]\n\n*** Personality can lean towards more \"outward\".\n*** Secrete / inner interchangeable afaik. For more subtly in narration, putting things like \"manipulative\" in Inner Traits can help. Haven't used \"mind\" or \"psychology\" phrasing, but probably the same thing.\n\nShe's got a dislikes and likes section as well, so it gets the gist of how to talk and when. The speech section was more about her style rather then timing.\n\nD&D alignment will make NPCs 2 dimensional. Haven't tried MBTI; MBTI has good, bad, etc so ChatGPT may cling onto the good parts. MBTI/Enneagram could probably be great for side characters when you want to save on tokens.\n\n==================================================================\n*** SOME GENERAL PROMPTING TIPS ***\n==================================================================\n\n- Don't put {{user}} thoughts/feelings in your replies. You can prompt 4.1 to ignore it or can prompt it to ignore hidden actions, but I was trying to cut down on tokens and took it out.\n- Only necessary to name the bot once.\n- Use numbered lists only for specific steps, otherwise output is stiff and can ignore stuff.\n- Sometimes negative commands are necessary, but try to avoid them when possible.\n- No more than 200 tokens per section for best adherence.\n- Typical LLM strongest to weakest: must > can > may. If > when.\n- NPC > Character. Less confusion, stronger adherence.\n- \"true to their personality\" vs \"true to their character\" or similar phrasing. Character has better adherence and less flat output.\n- \"Or\" is pretty useless when it's more than 2-3 options. And if you have 3 options, it tends to go with first or last, unless the middle word is its crack cocaine.\n- \"Etc\" is useless.\n- Sometimes broad terms like \"time\" work, sometimes they don't \"[personal] lives\". Another example in the personality prompt; yes, I tried shorter versions of the middle section and it was too weak.\n\n==================================================================\n*** JAILBREAKS / NSFW ***\n==================================================================\n\nMain jailbreaks are \"Project\", followed by \"Core\", then \"Output Length\" (bottom). \n\nDepends on your luck, but these should take care of most NSFW. Non-con usually needs \"Moderation\" at the bottom; quality takes a hit with it. I was too lazy to fine tune extreme gooning time.\n\n- Your Lorebook shouldn't need \"Moderation\", but: non-con, anal, apparently women consensually enjoying themselves by receiving head or climaxing in the scene are some things that can trigger the filter.\n- Typing certain words like in your reply will trigger the filter, but if you avoid using that particular word, it will usually go ahead and do it in its own reply.\n- If your first message/scenario starts off with non-con/trigger word in question, you shouldn't need \"moderation\".",
